Hashing is a method of directly computing the address of the record with the help of a key by using a
suitable mathematical function called the hash function. A hash table is an array-based structure used to
store pairs. In this chapter, we will learn about hashing, hash functions, and other related aspects.

Hash function: Hash function is one that maps a key in the range [0 to Max âˆ’ 1], the result of which is
used as an index (or address) in the hash table for storing and retrieving records
Bucket: A bucket is an index position in a hash table that can store more than one record
Probe: Each action of address calculation and check for success is called as a probe.
Collision: The result of two keys hashing into the same address is called collision.
Synonym: Keys that hash to the same address are called synonyms.
Collision Resolution Strategies:
1. Open Hashing
2. Separate Chaining or Linked List
3. Closed Hashing:
4. Linear Probing
5. Quadratic Probing
6. Double Hashing
7. Rehashing
Here we have implemented Linear Probing and Quadratic probing.

Linear Probing: A hash table in which a collision is resolved by placing the item in the next empty place
following the occupied place is called linear probing. This strategy looks for the next free location until it
is found.

(Hash(x)+ i) MOD Max

Quadratic Probing:
In quadratic probing, we add the offset as the square of the collision probe number. In quadratic probing,
the empty location is searched by using the following formula:
(Hash(Key) + i 2) MO D Max where i lies between 1 and (Max - 1)/2

ALGORITHM:
Function linear_probe(key, value):
i = key
for i in range(key, size):
key1 = (i + 1) % size # Calculating next empty location address using linear probing formula
if hashTable[key1] == -1: # If location is empty, insert data
hashTable[key1] = value
print(value, &quot;inserted at arr&quot;, key1)
break

Function quadratic_probe(key, value):
for i in range(key, size):
key1 = (key + i*i) % size # Quadratic Probing formula
if hashTable[key1] == -1:
hashTable[key1] = value
print(value, &quot;inserted at arr&quot;, key1)
break
